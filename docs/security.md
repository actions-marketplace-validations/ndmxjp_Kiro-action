# Security

This action gives a model write access to your repository, driven by text that
anyone can write. This page describes what is defended, and what is not.

## Who can trigger a run

- The actor must have `write` or `admin` permission on the repository. Everyone
  else is rejected before anything else happens.
- Bots cannot trigger runs unless they are listed in `allowed_bots` (or it is set
  to `*`).
- For `workflow_run` events, the actor that started the upstream run is checked
  as well.

Adding the trigger phrase to a comment is not, on its own, authorisation: it is
the _commenter's_ repository permission that decides.

## Prompt injection

Issue bodies, comments, and review comments are attacker-controlled data. Before
any of it reaches the prompt it is:

- **Pinned to trigger time.** Comments created or edited at/after the triggering
  event are dropped, and the issue/PR title and body come from the webhook
  payload rather than from a later API read. This closes the window where an
  attacker edits a comment after an authorised user triggers a run.
- **Stripped of hidden-instruction channels.** HTML comments, zero-width and
  bidi-override characters, markdown image alt text, link titles, and
  `alt`/`title`/`aria-label`/`data-*`/`placeholder` attributes are removed, and
  HTML entities outside printable ASCII are dropped.

The prompt also tells the model that only the triggering comment carries
instructions and that everything else is reference material. That is a mitigation,
not a guarantee: a sufficiently convincing comment may still steer the model.
Treat anything Kiro produces on a public repository as an untrusted proposal, and
keep required reviews on protected branches.

## Untrusted config in a pull request checkout

The CLI reads configuration from the working directory: agent definitions, MCP
server declarations, hooks, and steering files. On a pull request that directory
is written by the PR author, so before the CLI starts, these paths are replaced
with the versions from the base branch:

`.kiro/`, `.amazonq/`, `.mcp.json`, `AGENTS.md`, `KIRO.md`, `.gitmodules`,
`.ripgreprc`, `.husky/`

They are **deleted first and fetched afterwards**, because a hostile
`.gitmodules` present during a `git fetch` can make git reach out to
attacker-chosen remotes and hang the job on a credential prompt. If a path does
not exist on the base branch it stays deleted.

Consequences worth knowing:

- If a pull request legitimately changes `.kiro/`, and Kiro later commits with
  `git add -A`, the revert is included in that commit.
- Only those paths are restored. A base-branch hook that shells out through
  something a PR _can_ change (`bun run <script>`, a Makefile target, a
  repo-relative script) still executes the PR's version. Keep restored hooks
  self-contained.

## Shell and push

The agent is granted the `shell` capability but not a blanket allowance to use
it: the permission rules list specific commands (`git add`, `git commit`,
read-only git queries, and the push wrapper). Because `--no-interactive` has no
way to ask for approval, anything not on that list is denied.

`git push` is not on the list. Pushing goes through `scripts/git-push.sh`, which
accepts exactly `origin <branch|HEAD>`, rejects any argument starting with `-`,
and validates the ref with `git check-ref-format`. This exists because allowing
`git push` with arbitrary arguments is remote code execution:
`git push --receive-pack='sh -c ...' ext::sh origin` runs a shell. The upstream
project fixed the same issue after HackerOne report #3556799.

## Credentials

- `KIRO_API_KEY` is registered as a masked secret and never written to the
  execution log: output is passed through both a pattern-based redactor (GitHub,
  AWS, Slack, JWT shapes) and a literal-value redactor for the env secrets this
  action knows about.
- The credential `actions/checkout` leaves in `.git/config` is removed and
  replaced with this action's own token, so tools running in the working tree do
  not inherit the checkout's identity.
- The token is embedded in the `origin` remote URL, which is how pushes
  authenticate. It is therefore readable by anything that can run
  `git remote -v` — which is why `git config` and `git remote` are not on the
  shell allowlist.
- GitHub App tokens are revoked in an `always()` post step.

## Known gaps

These are real limitations, not oversights:

1. **File writes are not path-scoped.** The upstream Claude action restricts edits
   to the workspace via its `acceptEdits` permission mode. The Kiro CLI's agent
   config has no equivalent path scoping that this action can rely on, so the
   `write` and `code` tools are granted without a directory restriction. A
   sufficiently determined prompt injection could write outside the checkout
   (e.g. into `$HOME`). Runners are ephemeral, which limits the blast radius, but
   do not run this on a long-lived self-hosted runner that holds other secrets.
2. **`trust_all_tools: true` disables gating.** It is an escape hatch for trusted
   automation only.
3. **No commit signing.** The upstream action can commit through the GitHub API so
   commits are signed; this port commits with the git CLI, so commits are
   unsigned. A branch protection rule requiring signed commits will reject them.
4. **Inline review comments are not supported.** Kiro reports through one comment.
5. **No sandbox for non-write users.** The upstream action can run untrusted
   content in an isolated subprocess; this port simply refuses to run for actors
   without write access.

## Recommendations

- Gate the job with an `if:` condition on the trigger phrase so a runner is not
  started for every comment.
- Do not use `pull_request_target`. It runs with a token that has write access in
  the context of the _base_ repository while checking out fork code.
- Keep `permissions:` at the minimum the workflow needs. `actions: read` is only
  needed if you want CI-failure analysis.
- Require reviews on protected branches. Kiro cannot approve or merge, and it
  should stay that way.
- Report a vulnerability in this action by opening a security advisory on the
  repository rather than a public issue.
